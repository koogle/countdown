We are creating a simple minimal ios app that allows users to create count downs.
The user flow is as follows:
- the user opens the applicaiton and sees the list of count downs
- if there are no countdowns there is an outlines button to add a countdown in the empty state
- when the user adds a countdown it has a name
    - by default the countdown is one week from now
    - the user sets the date by default but can also set the time
- the user can add countdowns as widgets to their home screen or their lock screen
