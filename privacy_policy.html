    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: November 26, 2024</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how Simple Countdown App ("we," "our," or
      "us") handles information when you use our iOS mobile application (the
      "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent
      about our practices.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collection</h2>
    <p>
      Our App does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. All
      countdown data and settings are stored locally on your device and are not
      accessible to us or any third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All countdown information is stored exclusively on your device</li>
      <li>No data is transmitted to external servers</li>
      <li>No user analytics are collected</li>
      <li>No advertising identifiers are used</li>
      <li>No third-party services are implemented</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Our App does not collect any personal information from anyone, including
      children under the age of 13.
    </p>

    <h2>International Users</h2>
    <p>
      Our App is available worldwide and operates with the same
      no-data-collection policy regardless of your location. Since we don't
      collect any data, there are no international data transfers to consider.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of
      any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating
      the "Last Updated" date.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>
      If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at
      [your contact email].
    </p>

    <h2>California Privacy Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83-1798.84, California residents
      are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of personal
      information which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for
      marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates
      and/or third parties. Since we do not collect any user data, we have no
      information to share with third parties for marketing purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>Legal Basis (GDPR)</h2>
    <p>
      For users in the European Economic Area (EEA), since our App does not
      collect or process any personal data, we do not require a legal basis for
      data processing under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
